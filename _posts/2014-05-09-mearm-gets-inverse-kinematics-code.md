Gets whatnow? Well [Kinematics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kine-whatnow?")&nbsp;is the physics or maths of the movement of things. [Inverse kinematics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics) is the use of the equations of the movement of things to get the part of a robot to where you want it to go.&nbsp;

Bob Stone and Nick Moriarty of [York Hackspace](https://york.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Main_Page)&nbsp;set to first building one of our very first [MeArm Robots](http://www.phenoptix.com/products/mearm-pocket-sized-robot-arm "MeArm - Small Robot Arm")&nbsp;and then giving it some much needed brains by application of Inverse Kinematics. So that now you can provide a place in space with Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) and the claw will go there. They've shared the code on [Github](https://github.com/aquila12/me-arm-ik "IK+ MeArm - I loved IK+ best karate game ever.")&nbsp;as they are amazing and also a video on the youtube.&nbsp;
