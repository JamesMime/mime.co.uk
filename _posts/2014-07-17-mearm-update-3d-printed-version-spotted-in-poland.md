The twitter #meArm vanity search is working well for keeping track of what's happening with the #meArm around the world. The latest wild arm has been built in Poland by the mepi.pl team. It took them about half a day to print the #meArm, compared to about 21 minutes on a 40W laser cutter on a summer's day. They built it pretty fast after the print and seem to have some plans to build "an app for that" which is another exciting development.&nbsp;

Check out their video and the funky colours
