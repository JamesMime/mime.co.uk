Had a really strange phone call and did the thing I'm trying to do less of, I said "yes". Frankly it would have been silly to say no. The result is that I've just spent two days dusk till dawn hacking together a #meArm Grande. It only moves back and fowards as the axial rotation wasn't needed. It was packaged up yesterday and sent off for testing. The results of which I eagerly await!

Should it pass I'll be getting some feedback and building two more polished versions on a similarly tight deadline.

Fingers crossed!

Files of course are up. Open is everything for the #meArm project.
