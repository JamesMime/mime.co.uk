Had a new make on thingiverse this morning, which linked onto an amazing blog.

This was the image that caught my eye - they've made a [#meArm](http://www.phenoptix.com/collections/mearm) Army! Would love to know more about the base robot so if anyone knows get in touch at ben at phenoptix dot com.&nbsp;

There are loads more images on the [blog](http://mingshiuan.blogspot.com/2014/09/201408-3d_3.html), with lots of people posing with their #meArm and this great group shot

They've added a link to our thingiverse objected and mentioned the #meArm project. It is so exciting to see the #meArm being used for what it is meant to be used for - fun and education! This guy sums up how I feel about finding this post
