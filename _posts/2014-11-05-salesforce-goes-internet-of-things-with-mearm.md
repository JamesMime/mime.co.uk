I’ve been trying to track down a video of this for a while and fortunately one was sent to me today

In this video when a sale is made in Salesforce the #MeArm “ships” the product, well it throws it on the floor. But that is pretty much what couriers do right? (If any couriers are reading this we really appreciate your hard work and careful handling of our delicate robotics products (except if you’re the UPS doofus who dropkicked Adafruit’s last order…)). This #MeArm was shipping products all through the Dreamforce conference 2014.
