So we’ve gone nuclear and launched the [MeArm Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phenoptix/mearm-pocket-sized-industrial-robotics-for-everybo) to fund the MeBrain, our Arduino-Compatible controller board for the MeArm.  
It was a late night on Friday recording the video and it seems to have gone very well thanks to [Ali Foroughi at the Studio](http://aliforoughiphoto.co.uk/).

We’re looking for £5000 to get the project into full swing. [Check it out here!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phenoptix/mearm-pocket-sized-industrial-robotics-for-everybo "MeArm Kickstarter")
