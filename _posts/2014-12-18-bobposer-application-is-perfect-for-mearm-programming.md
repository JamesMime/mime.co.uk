One of my favourite MeArm videos on Youtube (by Robert Fischer) was made using a program called the BoBPoser Application.  
BoB is a cool Bipedal robot featured on [Let’s Make Robots](http://letsmakerobots.com/node/35865) and the application was developed for the FOBO Robot ([as seen here](http://www.projectbiped.com/prototypes/fobo)).

Fortunately for us BoB uses four servos and the application is a great way to manipulate them! Thus we use it to manipulate the MeArm and these are the sort of results we can expect!
