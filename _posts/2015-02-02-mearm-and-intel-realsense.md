[Intel RealSense](http://click.intel.com/intel-realsense-developer-kit.html "Intel RealSense developer kit") is not something I’ve come across before seeing this video but it’s definitely something I’d like to investigate further. At $99 it seems a real steal to get your hands on a developer version of Intel’s flagship gesture control camera. It would appear that you reserve online a $1 and then are selected to receive the pack, for just another $98.  
Fortunately for the MeArm one of the people who received a developer kit was Bryan Brown, who also it seems has been shopping at [Adafruit and has a nice Heisenberg Blue MeArm](http://www.adafruit.com/products/2012)! Bryan put the two together with some magic sauce (and not yet open source!) and came up with this fantastic gesture control MeArm.
