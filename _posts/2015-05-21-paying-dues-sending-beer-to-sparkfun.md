We’re very close to fulfilling the Kickstarter now and stock is arriving from the four corners of the globe. This week the Pro Micro clones arrived. These are just a bit cheaper than the [originals from Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12587) but nowhere near as cool in green. As an Open Source design the Chinese manufacturer should have placed an attribution on the board but as they come without attribution you’ll find it on the on our MeArm Brains PCB.

We also thought it would be good if Sparkfun were to get something out of the deal since they provided the designs for us all to use and abuse. This is what we sent them:
