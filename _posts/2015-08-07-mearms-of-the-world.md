People always ask where we’ve sent MeArms in the world. So we thought we’d put together a map with the data we had to hand. All we’ve used is City and Country and no other data whatsoever has been passed to Google. This gives a good overview of the official MeArms of the World!

We’d love to collect more data on the Wild MeArms of the World so if anyone can help us with a web form or similar to help populate Google Maps that would be great!
