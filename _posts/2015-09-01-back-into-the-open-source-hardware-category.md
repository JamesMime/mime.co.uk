Those that know me understand just how “ranty” I can get about Open Source Hardware, so much so that I’m giving a talk at this year’s [Wuthering Bytes Festival at Hebden Bridge ](http://wutheringbytes.com/)about [“Open Washing” your product](http://wutheringbytes.com/days/oshcamp/talks.html) and making your millions. Those who are really observant will have noticed that the MeArm v1.0 shipped last month, but the source files remained in my desk drawer! Well that’s all changed as of this morning. The files are now available in [dxf format on thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:993759). So now you can cut it in any colour you want!  
I’ve also uploaded the latest files for the Brains Board over [on Github](https://github.com/MeArm/Hardware/tree/master/brains). So we’re back to be Open Source, all the way down…
