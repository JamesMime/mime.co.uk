The [MeArm Sliders Board](http://mearm.com/products/mearm-sliders-robot-controller) started as part of our schools demonstration kit as it was large, tactile and allowed you to have a very responsive MeArm. It even made it into our Kickstarter where it was a very popular kit upgrade. It has now at last come to our store, as we've finally made a few more!

Our first batch were made with the help of those lovely robots over at Pimoroni with their fantastic ETS250 Wave Flow Soldering machine. This is essentially a tame Cyberdyne T1000 Terminator unit that gives of its polymorphic body to make electronic gizmos. Either that or a beast of a heater that liquefies 120kg of solder to run PCBs through.

The Sliders are a fairly simple design, consisting of just four slide potentiometers and two tactile switches on a large, sturdy PCB. We provide an acrylic case and some caps for the slide potentiometers to make a rather lovely controller brick for your MeArm (or other robot). It can be used anywhere that you can read analogue inputs and of course works extremely well with our [MeArm Brains Board](http://mearm.com/collections/mearm/products/mearm-brains-board-with-lcd-and-joysticks).

Being such a simple controller they're easy to program to control your MeArm, we have some code available so you can use the Sliders and Joysticks boards and switch between the two:

The MeArm Sliders Board gives you great instantaneous control over the MeArm, allowing fast movement and fine control. We're really happy with them, we hope you will be too. [Check them out here](http://mearm.com/products/mearm-sliders-robot-controller).

Hope you appreciate the funky sound track!
