It's exciting to see what can be done when you start to hack and modify the MeArm. One amazing customer / hacker has made a high tech soft gripper for the MeArm, using some 3D printed parts and some tubing. Check out the video here

In addition to the video XYZAidan has made an instructable and has entered into the Full Spectrum Laser contest. It would be fantastic for such a creative maker to have access to his own laser cutter, so please [visit his page and give him your vote](http://www.instructables.com/id/A-Soft-Robotic-Gripper-for-the-MeArm/)!
